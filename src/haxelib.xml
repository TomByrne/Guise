    <description>A GUI library where UI logic is seperated from skinning/drawing logic, allowing for a completely cross-platform UI library. The first set of skin classes will target the EaselJS Canvas DisplayList library. The library is based heavily on a composition design pattern, overcoming many of the issues encountered by sprawling chains of inheritance common to other UI libraries.</description>
