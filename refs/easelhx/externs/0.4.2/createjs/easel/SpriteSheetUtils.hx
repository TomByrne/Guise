/**
*	The SpriteSheetUtils class is a collection of static methods for working

*	combined into a single image on a regular grid. For example, an animation consisting
*	of 8 100x100 images could be combined into a 400x200 sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high).
*	The SpriteSheetUtils class uses a static interface and should not be instantiated.
