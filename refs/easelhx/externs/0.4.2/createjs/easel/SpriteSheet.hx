/**
*	Encapsulates the properties and methods associated with a sprite sheet. A sprite sheet is a series of images (usually animation frames) combined
*	into a larger image (or images). For example, an animation consisting of 8 100x100 images could be combined into a 400x200
*	sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high).<br/><br/>
*	The data passed to the SpriteSheet constructor defines three critical pieces of information:<OL>
*	   <LI> The image or images to use.</LI>
*	   <LI> The positions of individual image frames. This data can be represented in one of two ways:
*	   As a regular grid of sequential, equal-sized frames, or as individually defined, variable sized frames arranged in an irregular (non-sequential) fashion.</LI>
*	   <LI> Likewise, animations can be represented in two ways: As a series of sequential frames, defined by a start and end frame [0,3], or as a list of frames [0,1,2,3].
*	</OL>
*	The easiest way to understand the data format is to see an example:
*	<pre><code>data = {
*	&nbsp;
*	// DEFINING IMAGES:
*	&#9;// list of images or image URIs to use. SpriteSheet can handle preloading.
*	&#9;// the order dictates their index value for frame definition.
*	&#9;images: [image1, "path/to/image2.png"],
*	&nbsp;
*	// DEFINING FRAMES:
*	&nbsp;
*	&#9;// the simple way to define frames, only requires frame size because frames are consecutive:
*	&#9;// define frame width/height, and optionally the frame count and registration point x/y.
*	&#9;// if count is omitted, it will be calculated automatically based on image dimensions.
*	&#9;frames: {width:64, height:64, count:20, regX: 32, regY:64},
*	&nbsp;
*	&#9;// OR, the complex way that defines individual rects for frames.
*	&#9;// The 5th value is the image index per the list defined in "images" (defaults to 0).
*	&#9;frames: [
*	&#9;	// x, y, width, height, imageIndex, regX, regY
*	&#9;	[0,0,64,64,0,32,64],
*	&#9;	[64,0,96,64,0]
*	&#9;],
*	&nbsp;
*	// DEFINING ANIMATIONS:
*	&nbsp;
*	&#9;// simple animation definitions. Define a consecutive range of frames.
*	&#9;// also optionally define a "next" animation name for sequencing.
*	&#9;// setting next to false makes it pause when it reaches the end.
*	&#9;animations: {
*	&#9;	// start, end, next, frequency
*	&#9;	run: [0,8],
*	&#9;	jump: [9,12,"run",2],
*	&#9;	stand: [13]
*	&#9;}
*	&nbsp;
*	&#9;// the complex approach which specifies every frame in the animation by index.
*	&#9;animations: {
*	&#9;	run: {
*	&#9;		frames: [1,2,3,3,2,1]
*	&#9;	},
*	&#9;	jump: {
*	&#9;		frames: [1,4,5,6,1],
*	&#9;		next: "run",
*	&#9;		frequency: 2
*	&#9;	},
*	&#9;	stand: { frames: [7] }
*	&#9;}
*	&nbsp;
*	&#9;// the above two approaches can be combined, you can also use a single frame definition:
*	&#9;animations: {
*	&#9;	run: [0,8,true,2],
*	&#9;	jump: {
*	&#9;		frames: [8,9,10,9,8],
*	&#9;		next: "run",
*	&#9;		frequency: 2
*	&#9;	},
*	&#9;	stand:7
*	&#9;}
*	}</code></pre>
*	&nbsp;
*	For example, to define a simple sprite sheet, with a single image "sprites.jpg" arranged in a regular 50x50 grid
*	with two animations, "run" looping from frame 0-4 inclusive, and "jump" playing from frame 5-8 and sequencing back to run:
*	<pre><code>data = {
*	&#9;images: ["sprites.jpg"],
*	&#9;frames: {width:50, height:50},
*	&#9;animations: {run:[0,4], jump:[5,8,"run"]}
*	}</code></pre>
