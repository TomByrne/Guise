*	A DOMElement allows you to associate a HTMLElement with the display list. It will be transformed
*	within the DOM as though it is child of the Container it is added to. However, it is not rendered
*	to canvas, and as such will retain whatever z-index it has relative to the canvas (ie. it will be
*	drawn in front of or behind the canvas).<br/><br/>
*	The position of a DOMElement is relative to their parent node in the DOM. It is recommended that
*	the DOM Object be added to a div that also contains the canvas so that they share the same position
*	on the page.<br/><br/>
*	DOMElement is useful for positioning HTML elements over top of canvas content, and for elements
*	that you want to display outside the bounds of the canvas. For example, a tooltip with rich HTML
*	content.<br/><br/>
*	DOMElement instances are not full EaselJS display objects, and do not participate in EaselJS mouse
*	events or support methods like hitTest.
